/// The client's handle to the inbound (server → client) direction of a
/// streaming call: a single-iteration `AsyncSequence` of response `Element`s,
/// plus graceful ``stop()`` / abnormal ``cancel()`` control and an awaitable
/// ``result()`` terminal.
///
/// For a **server-streaming** call (`ServerStreamMethod`) this is the whole
/// handle, with `OutboundElement == Never`. A **bidirectional** call vends the
/// same type as ``BidirectionalStreamHandle/inbound``, generalized over the
/// request direction's element type — one implementation, both shapes.
///
/// ## Consumption drives credit
///
/// Iterating the sequence is what grants credit back to the server: the initial
/// window (8) arrives unprompted, and each further window the consumer drains
/// emits a credit grant (watermark-batched). A consumer that stops draining
/// stops granting — the server parks at zero credit and memory stays bounded by
/// the window. **Iterate from a task that does not also await other traffic on
/// this connection** (the same head-of-line caveat as any backpressured stream).
///
/// ## Termination (client view of the matrix)
///
/// - Server END + nil-error terminal → the sequence finishes, ``result()`` is
///   `.success(Response)`.
/// - Terminal with error → the sequence finishes, ``result()`` is
///   `.failure(mapped)` (code 7 → `.cancelled`, code 6 → `.streamViolation`,
///   others per `MMCallError.from(error:)`).
/// - ``stop()`` sends STOP (graceful, advisory); the call still runs to its
///   terminal, items in flight still arrive.
/// - ``cancel()`` (or cancelling the consuming task) sends CANCEL; every surface
///   resolves `.cancelled` locally and the server's code-7 terminal is dropped.
/// - Connection death → the sequence finishes and ``result()`` resolves
///   `.transport` / `.connectionClosed`, exactly like a unary call.
///
/// Single iterator (the underlying producer permits one). ``result()`` may be
/// awaited after the sequence ends or concurrently, any number of times; it
/// resolves exactly once.

///   cancelled at scope exit; here the sibling can neither leak nor be torn
///   down mid-element, and every `each` has completed before this returns —
///   so an ``InboundStreamHandle/result()`` read after it is ordered after
///   all element handling.
///
/// Ending the sequence is still the caller's story: it ends on server END or
/// terminal, after ``InboundStreamHandle/stop()`` (which `each` may call —
/// e.g. after N elements), or on connection death. A body that returns while
/// the server streams on simply waits here for the stream to end.

/// the sequence has ended, and the sequence only ends once the terminal (or
